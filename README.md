# README.md

## Instructions

Your task is to:

- Complete each Jupyter notebook in the `todo` folder.
- Understand the code and complete any exercises.

In particular, the files to complete are:

- `todo/Lesson1.ipynb`
- `todo/Lesson2.ipynb`
- `todo/Lesson3.ipynb`

There are several options to complete these lessons. One option is to clone the repo and complete it locally, such as in VS Code. The other option is to copy the link of each lesson to Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>

Choose the option that makes the most sense to you.

### Colab instructions

1. Open Colab in a new tab.
2. If not already on the "Open notebook" popup, goto `File`-> `Open Notebook`.
3. In the left sidebar of the popup, click `GitHub`.
4. Find the link to the desired lesson. For example, <https://github.com/sroscoe2/CS485-GT-code/blob/master/todo/Lesson1.ipynb>
5. Copy the link to that lesson, and paste it in the Colab search box.
6. Hit Enter, and the notebook should load in that same tab.
7. Run the first code cell to verify it works.

### VS Code instructions

1. Copy the link to this repository, and clone it in VS Code.
2. Open a new terminal (Ctrl + \` (backtick))
3. Type `sh installJupyter.sh` to setup the virtual environment and install necessary packages.
4. Open the desired lesson.
5. Select the kernel to be your newly-created `venv`.
6. Run the first code cell to verify it works.
